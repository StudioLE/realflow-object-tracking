# Tracking Objects in RealFlow

A [node.js](http://nodejs.org/) utility to convert `.obj` files exported from RealFlow to `.csv` files for importing to Grasshopper.

### The scenario

You've got a of objects that move within a RealFlow scene and you would like to track their coordinates frame by frame so you can import and plot the data in Grasshopper.

### The solution

1. Enable the export of `.asc` files for each object in RealFlow
2. Simulate the scene
3. [Download](https://github.com/StudioLE/realflow-object-tracking/archive/master.zip), install & run obj_to_csv.js on your scene's objects folder (instructions below)
4. Download & open the Grasshopper Import file
5. Set the path to the `.csv` file generated by obj_to_csv.js

## Installation

The application requires Node.js and npm to be installed, instructions can be found at [nodejs.org](http://nodejs.org/). Then follow one of the methods below to download the application.

##### Git Clone
```

```

##### Manual

- Download the [latest zip from GitHub](https://github.com/StudioLE/realflow-object-tracking/archive/master.zip) and extract to a clean directory
- Open the Node.js command prompt and change to the realflow-object-tracking directory using the command:
