# Tracking Objects in RealFlow

A [node.js](http://nodejs.org/) utility to convert `.obj` files exported from RealFlow to `.csv` files for importing to Grasshopper.

### The scenario

You've got a series of objects that move within a RealFlow scene and you would like to track their coordinates frame by frame so you can import and plot the data in Grasshopper.

### The solution

1. Enable the export of `.asc` files for each object in RealFlow
2. Simulate the scene
3. Download, install & run obj_to_csv on your scene's objects folder (instructions below)
4. Download & open the Grasshopper Import file
5. Set the path to the `.csv` file generated by obj_to_csv.js

## Installation

The application requires Node.js and npm to be installed, instructions can be found at [nodejs.org](http://nodejs.org/). Then follow the following steps:

- Download the [latest zip from GitHub](https://github.com/StudioLE/realflow-object-tracking/archive/master.zip) and extract to a clean directory
- Open the Node.js command prompt and change to the realflow-object-tracking directory using the command:
```
cd C:\Users\path\to\realflow-object-tracking\
```
- Run `npm update` to install & update realflow-object-tracking's dependencies
```
npm update
```

## Configuration

Once installed ensure to change the `source_directory` variable in the `./config.js` file to your RealFlow scene objects folder and `object_name` to match the name of your object.

You may also like to change the other settings:

- `source_directory` The objects folder of your RealFlow scene

- `object_name` Name of the RealFlow object you wish to track

- `export_directory` Directory to export files to

- `track_frames` An array of frame numbers to track

- `track_mode` Track the object vertices using `vert` or midpoints with `mid`

## Usage

To run the utility change to the relevant directory and run `node obj_to_csv`

```
cd C:\Users\path\to\realflow-object-tracking\
node obj_to_csv
```

## Troubleshooting
